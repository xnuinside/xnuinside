### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Python enthusiast and I like do ðŸ”­ **experiments** **in** **code generation** & **metaprogramming**. 

ðŸŒ± If you interesting to participate in any project: **feel free** to open PR or ðŸ’¬ issue, I'm very glad to any participation.

Right now, :farmer: I'm focusing on supporting & adding new features to (but honestly - I don't have a time :(():

* [simple-ddl-parser](https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser) - Parser that focudes on differen DDL dialects and only DDL

* [omymodels](https://github.com/xnuinside/omymodels) - Code generator that allows you to create different Python Modules from DDL and convert one model type to another


If you need any help or want to collobarate anyhow: contact me via mail xnuinside@gmail.com or t.me/xnuinside
