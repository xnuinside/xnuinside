### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Python enthusiast and I like do ðŸ”­ **experiments** **in** **code generation** & **metaprogramming**. 

ðŸŒ± If you interesting to participate in any project: **feel free** to open PR or ðŸ’¬ issue, I'm very glad to any participation.

I also participate as a Program committee Member of cute & friendly conference PiterPy https://piterpy.com/en/ (We alwasy welcome for the new speakers, if you have a theme to talk about - don't afraid to send CFP, if you have some doubts - you can ask any questions to me in telegram  t.me/xnuinside, feel free to do this)

Right now, :farmer: I'm focusing on supporting & adding new features to (but honestly - I don't have a time :(():

* [simple-ddl-parser](https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser) - Parser that focudes on differen DDL dialects and only DDL

* [omymodels](https://github.com/xnuinside/omymodels) - Code generator that allows you to create different Python Modules from DDL and convert one model type to another
