### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Python enthusiast and I like do ðŸ”­ **experiments** **in** **code generation** & **metaprogramming**. 

ðŸŒ± If you interesting to participate in any project: **feel free** to open PR or ðŸ’¬ issue, I very glad to anyone.

Right now, :farmer: I'm focusing on supporting & adding new features to:

* [simple-ddl-parser](https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser) - Parser that focudes on differen DDL dialects and only DDL

* [omymodels](https://github.com/xnuinside/omymodels) - Code generator that allows you to create different Python Modules from DDL and convert one model type to another

* [py-models-parser](https://github.com/xnuinside/py-models-parser) - Parser that supported already 12 types of different Python models (ORM, Pydantic and etc)

* [fakeme](https://github.com/xnuinside/fakeme) - Fake Data generator for relative data (for example, for SQL tables)
